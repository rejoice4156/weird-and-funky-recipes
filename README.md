# Weird & Funky Recipes

This is a website full of weird and funky recipes that ChatGPT has come up with after I told it to. The images are genereted using DALL-E and I quite like them. All html code is fully written by me (with some help from the VSCode LSP). Enjoy!

## Learning Outcomes

I already knew basic html, so creating this was not that hard for me. I had fun coming up with this site theme and idea though and I did learn some cool tricks relating to links like how to make them open in a new tab and make sure the new tab does not know where it came from.
