<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is not my recipe for my other favorite dish, mac and cheese.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups magic elbow noodles (imported from the land of bendy pasta)</li>
    <li>3 blocks of enchanted cheddar cheese (sharp enough to cut through bad vibes)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of moonbeam milk (straight from the Milky Way)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon of butter of eternal smoothness</li>
    <li>A pinch of dragon's breath (also known as paprika)</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons of unicorn tears (substitute with regular salt if unicorns are unavailable)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of pixie dust (or Parmesan cheese, but that’s way less fun)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of spontaneous combustion powder (AKA cayenne pepper for brave souls)</li>
    <li>1 overly dramatic onion (only to be used for tears)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Summon your cauldron (or a regular pot, whatever works) and fill it with water from the River of Eternal Boil.
        Set it on
        high heat and wait for bubbling chaos to ensue.</li>
    <li>Add the magic elbow noodles and chant “Noodles bend, don’t break!” 7 times. Cook them until they achieve the
        perfect al
        dente balance between squish and snap.</li>
    <li>While the noodles are absorbing their powers, melt your butter of eternal smoothness in a pan over medium heat.
        Add the
        overly dramatic onion, and sauté until it cries rivers.</li>
    <li>Slowly pour in the moonbeam milk while whispering ancient dairy incantations, allowing the sauce to thicken.
    </li>
    <li>Grate the enchanted cheddar cheese (careful not to let it cut your soul) and stir it into the sauce until it
        melts into
        a cheesy, golden elixir of life.</li>
    <li>Toss in a pinch of dragon’s breath to give the dish a fiery kick and just the right amount of mystical
        spiciness.</li>
    <li>Drain the now-alchemized noodles and mix them into the cheese sauce, ensuring each noodle is coated in gooey,
        cheesy
        magic.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with pixie dust and unicorn tears, letting the flavors and whimsy of the universe bind the dish
        together.</li>
    <li>For the courageous, a light dusting of spontaneous combustion powder will awaken the taste buds and possibly the
        spirit
        realm.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately before the cheese’s magic fades. Beware of spontaneous floating after consumption!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
