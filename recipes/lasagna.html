<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is not my recipe for my favorite dish, lasagna.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>12 sheets of “Gourmet-Approved” lasagna noodles (or, you know, regular cardboard works too)</li>
  <li>3 cups of Vegan Unicorn Cheese (from the mystical land of Lactose-Free-istan)</li>
  <li>2 lbs of Ground Beef (or T-Rex meat if you're feeling fancy)</li>
  <li>1 jar of Grandma’s Secret Tomato Sauce (or whatever’s in that jar at the back of the fridge)</li>
  <li>1 whole Imaginary Eggplant (picked fresh from the garden of your mind)</li>
  <li>2 cups of “Not So Fresh” Spinach (don’t worry, it adds flavor... probably)</li>
  <li>5 cloves of Garlic of Eternal Life (ensures immortality or at least repels vampires)</li>
  <li>A dash of Dragon Tears (or a splash of tap water... your choice)</li>
  <li>1 cup of Grated Optimism (optional, but recommended)</li>
  <li>1 Mystical Baking Pan (seriously, don't try this without one)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat your oven to “Hope It’s the Right Temperature” degrees. (No one really knows what 375°F feels like.)</li>
  <li>Boil the lasagna noodles until they achieve “Floppy Yet Not Too Sad” texture. (Drain them, then contemplate life
    while
    they cool.)</li>
  <li>In a cauldron, combine the ground beef (or dinosaur meat) with Garlic of Eternal Life until your kitchen smells
    like it
    could banish spirits.</li>
  <li>Layer the noodles in the Mystical Baking Pan like you're building the world’s most unsteady Jenga tower.</li>
  <li>Spread a healthy layer of Grandma’s Secret Tomato Sauce (even though we all know it’s just from a jar) over the
    noodles.
    Pretend you made it from scratch.</li>
  <li>Add a sprinkling of Grated Optimism to the sauce layer, because at this point, we all need a little positivity.
  </li>
  <li>Carefully arrange the Vegan Unicorn Cheese as if it holds the secrets of the universe.</li>
  <li>Toss in the Imaginary Eggplant for good measure. You won't see it, but trust me, it's in there.</li>
  <li>Repeat layers until your Mystical Baking Pan starts to look like an ancient artifact of cheesy goodness.</li>
  <li>Cover the lasagna with a generous layer of Dragon Tears (or aluminum foil if your dragons are on strike).</li>
  <li>Bake for 40 minutes, or until your kitchen fills with the scent of Questionable Decisions.</li>
  <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes, unless you enjoy the thrill of molten cheese burns.</li>
  <li>Serve immediately and enjoy the Weirdest Lasagna Ever, with a side of disbelief and confusion!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p>
